2. **Choose your email provider**
   - **Gmail** (Recommended for beginners)

### Step 5: Update Your Website Code

1. **Open your consultation.html file**
   - Find the JavaScript section at the bottom

2. **Replace the placeholder values**
   - Find this line: `emailjs.init("YOUR_USER_ID");`
   - Replace `YOUR_USER_ID` with your actual User ID

3. **Update Service and Template IDs**
   - Find this line: `emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', templateParams)`
   - Replace `YOUR_SERVICE_ID` with your Service ID
   - Replace `YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID` with your Template ID

**Example of updated code:**
```javascript
// Initialize EmailJS
(function() {
  emailjs.init("user_abc123def456"); // Your actual User ID
})();

// In the form submission function:
emailjs.send('service_xyz789', 'template_uvw456', templateParams)
```
